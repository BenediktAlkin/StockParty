indicator for current time to check how far apart different devices are
bartender +-= depends on slope not current price

## Ideas
- some indication of crash
  - flickering
- bartenders can add metres to teams
  - maybe register teams prior to event
  - bartenders use their phones/tablets
  - make sure these numbers can be corrected
